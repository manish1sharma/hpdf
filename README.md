This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I have kept the erroneous cloned twitter search page in a separate repository. Its link is 
(https://github.com/manishgrd/twitsearch)

I am quite new to designing web elements through React (or
Materia-Ui) let alone html or css. I have read theoretically about all these things but it was a first hands-on
experience. All critisims about the errors are welcome, as I know I have made a lot of them!! Thank you.

To get started perform the following steps on a windows 7/8/10 pc
1.	Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2.	Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win and start Git bash.
3.	Create a directory (say C:/projects/ ) & enter it.
4.	Clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/manishgrd/hpdf.git)
5.	On gitbash run the command $npm install
    This will install all the required dependencies for the project.
    It should complete without error and a few warnings ( you can ignore it).
6.	Run $npm start . This will launch the project in your default web-browser
    with address localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000
7.	There it is, the cloned twitter page is up & running. 

(OPTIONAL)

8.	Repeat steps 4 to 6 to check the erroneous cloned search page. 
The repository link is (https://github.com/manishgrd/twitsearch)

9.	This page will be integrated in the original project after the bugs are removed.
10.	This project is not bug free. Any comments or feedback is appreciated. Drop an email at manish160490@gmail.com
